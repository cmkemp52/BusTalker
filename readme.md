Uses MARTA's APIs and presents the data in a way that'll be useful for a commuter waiting for their bus or train. Users will be able to load the program, have their location auto-populate, and be able to visually see if their bus is nearby.

Uses Leafletjs to display a lightweight mobile friendly map. Also makes use of Canvasjs to display a chart showing what percentages of MARTAs buses are on time.

Styled using Bootstrap and CSS.
